# Overview
New Life was a game I was building to learn how to use graphics 
libraries and have fun learing.

The current program is not much more then a basic tile map with collisions, and a movable player sprite.

# Development Environment
The lagage used was c++ from the ubuntu apt repositories.

My edditer is vim/neovim and vs code.

The graphics libray I used was SFML and c++.
