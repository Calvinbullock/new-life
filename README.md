# Overview

New Life was a game I was building to learn more about using libraries and have fun learning more c++.

The actual program is not much more than a basic tile map with collisions, and a few sprites sprite, so far.

# Running
- Run the script `run.sh`, it will compile an update binary the run it.

# Compiling

## Linux / Mac
- `mkdir build`  may need to make the build dir
- `cd build`     move into the build dir
- `cmake ..`     run the cmake conf in the parent dir
- `make`         run the newly build make file
- `./newLifeEXE` run the binary file
- `chmod +x newLifeEXE` may need to give the binary executable permission.

# Development Environment
Editors / Tools:
- Neovim
- VS code
- clang-format
- Make / Cmake

Languages/frameworks/libraries:
- c++
- sfml graphics library.

# Useful Websites
* [SFML docs](https://www.sfml-dev.org/documentation/2.6.1/)
* [google c++ style guides](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html)

# Future Work
* Item 1: Enemy movement.
* Item 2: damage and health for players and enemies.
* Item 3: More levels / maps.

# Images
- Images look blurry but that is the game itself *(I have not properly handled scaling)*.
