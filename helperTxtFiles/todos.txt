-- in gameWorld.cpp figure out how to do somehitng like this:

 void GameWorld::setUpTiles()
 {
     ** ISSUE The postions (x,y) in the constucter make things hard....
     GameTile *rw = new GameTile("images/rockWall.png", x, y, false, false);
     GameTile *sd = new GameTile("images/stoneDoor.png", x, y, true, true);

     std::vector<GameTile *>{
         rw,
         sd,
         rw,
         rw,
         rw,
         rw,
         rw,
     };
 }

 -- Move Postion out of the GameTile and into a new location..... 
    - Use the postion in the array 0 = 0, 1 = 50, 2 = 100, etc
  
-- HIND SIGHT 
    if I had made tiles, player, items and enemies all a 
    child of a common class then collistions and the action / effects
    between entitys would be so much easer to just have a function
    in the parent class that takes to entities (children) says what do
    each of you wnat then so that if pareamiters / collision are meet.
